Rails application that dynamically generates a quiz that can be taken by the user. It displays results immediately after the quiz is submitted. 

Project Description:
The "questions" and "choices" reside at the server end in a sqlite database. Rails generates web services. Client application in JavaScript extracts questions and choices from these web services, collects answers by the user, processes them and shows the result.

Other mentions:
This is a demonstration of how easily and quickly a complete web application can be built using Rails framework.

But, there is no free lunch.
1. Learning curve of Ruby is long.
2. Rails is not suitable for more complex applications (well, it is a subjective issue, but it is general opinion for many including me) such as extracting specific values from the table rows and columns. You can search more on internet about why Rails in not suitable for complex web applcation.

But, without doubt Rails is great(awesome, beautiful,....all good words) for simple applications.

Implications:
This perticular application can be converted to whole survey hosting website (within 2 hours), Online exams, Educational games etc.
